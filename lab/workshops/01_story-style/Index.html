        1. In the scorching summer of 2011, my dad took me to his office.

        2. As he delved into the meeting with his employees, I lay on the chair before his computer. With nothing better to do, I ended up tapping his keyboard curiously.

        3. Meanwhile, a QQ message pops out. Recognizing the familiar platform, I decided to take the plunge and create my own QQ account. Since I had been gathering my friends' account numbers several months before, my deskmate was the first person I added.

        4. Once everything was set up, I found myself engrossed in this new digital landscape - every button I pressed and every move I made on that thing felt like stumbling into a new world. During the exploration, I came up with my first internet name, "snowflakes,” and an ice cream as my portrait photo.

        5. When my dad finally emerged from his meeting, he teased me about the name and photo, saying he would always want to send me a message during summer only because he could feel the coolness of this “snowflake” and “ice cream.”
