        <p class="left"><font color="#0000ff">the number of beginnings so far exceeds the number of endings that we cannot even conceive of it.</font></p>

        <p class="left"><font color="#0000ff">Not every poem is finished—one poem is abandoned, another catches fire and is carried away by the wind, which may be an ending, but it is the ending of a poem without an end. </font></p>

    <p class="left"><font color="#d1197b">The opening line of a poem is like finding a fruit on the ground, a piece of fallen fruit you have never seen before, and the poet’s task is to create the tre from which such a fruit would fall. </font></p>
