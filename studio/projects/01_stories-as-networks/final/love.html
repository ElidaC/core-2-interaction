        <p class="left"><font color="#0000ff">Hard lot!</font></p>
        <p class="left"><font color="#0000ff">But the poem, no matter how full of possibility, has to exist!</font></p>
        <p class="left"><font color="#0000ff">To conduct oneself, to behave. How a poem acts marks its individual character. A poem by Glandolyn Blue does not sound like a poem by Timothy Sure. To pretend, feign, impersonate. That, too, yes and always, because self-consciousness is its own pretension, and has been from its beginning; the human mind is capable of a great elastic theatre. </font></p>

        <div class="fade">
            <p class="left"><font color="#0000ff">The weird theatrical shit is what goes on around us every day of our lives; an animal of only instinct, Johnny Ferret, has in his actions drama, but no theater; theater requires that you draw a circle around the action and observe it from outside the circle; in other words, self-consciousness is theatre.  </font></p>

            <p class="left"><font color="#0000ff">Everyone knows that if you query poets about how their poems begin, the answer is always the same:  </font></p>

        <div class="fade">
            <p class="right"><font color="#f99615">a phrase, a line, a scrap of language, a rhythm, an image, something seen, heard, witnessed, or imagined. </font></p>

            <p class="left"><font color="#0000ff">And the lesson is always the same, and young poets recognize this to be one of the most important lessons they can learn:
