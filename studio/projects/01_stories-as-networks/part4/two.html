        <p class="right"><font color="#f99615">no one has yet to begin a life who will not end it??</font></p>

        <p class="left"><font color="#0000ff">In poetry, </font></p>
        <p class="left"><font color="#0000ff">the number of beginnings so far exceeds the number of endings that we cannot even conceive of it.</font></p>

        <p class="left"><font color="#0000ff">Not every poem is finished‚Äîone poem is abandoned, another catches fire and is carried away by the wind, which may be an ending, but it is the ending of a poem without an end. </font></p>


    <h5 align="center"><font size="1px" color="3c3c3c">Paul Val√©ry joined the group chat</font></h5>



    <p class="left"><font color="#d1197b">No poem is ever ended, that every poem is merely abandoned. </font></p>



    <p class="left"><font color="#0000ff">This saying is also attributed to St√©phane Mallarm√©, for where quotations begin is in a cloud. </font></p>



    <p class="right"><font color="#f99615">@Paul Val√©ry</font></p>


    <p class="right"><font color="#f99615">also described the perception of first lines so vividly, and to my mind so accurately, that I have never forgotten it.</font></p>



    <p class="left"><font color="#d1197b">The opening line of a poem is like finding a fruit on the ground, a piece of fallen fruit you have never seen before, and the poet‚Äôs task is to create the tre from which such a fruit would fall. </font></p>



    <p class="left"><font color="#0000ff">In the beginning was the Word. </font></p>


    <p class="left"><font color="#0000ff">Western civilization rests upon those words. And yet there is a lively group of thinkers who believe that in the beginning was the Act that nothing can precede action‚Äî</font></p>



    <p class="right"><font color="#f99615">no breath before act, no thought before act, no pervasive love before some kind of act!</font></p>



    <p class="left"><font color="#0000ff">I believe the poem is an act of the mind.</font></p>


    <p class="left"><font color="#0000ff">I think it is easier to talk about the end of a poem than it is to talk about its beginning. </font></p>


    <p class="left"><font color="#0000ff">Because the poem ends on the page, but it begins off the page, it begins in the mind. The mind acts, the mind wills a poem, often against our own will; somehow this happens, somehow a poem gets written in the middle of a chaotic holiday party that has just run out of ice, </font></p>



    <p class="right"><font color="#f99615">and it's your house.</font></p>



    <p class="left"><font color="#0000ff">An act of the mind. </font></p>



    <p class="right"><font color="#f99615">To move, to make happen, to manifest. Be an act of Congress. A state of real existence rather than possibility.</font></p>

    <p class="right"><font color="#f99615">And poets love possibility! </font></p>
 
        <p class="left"><font color="#0000ff">They love to wonder and explore.</font></p>
        <p class="left"><font color="#0000ff">Hard lot!</font></p>
        <p class="left"><font color="#0000ff">But the poem, no matter how full of possibility, has to exist!</font></p>
        <p class="left"><font color="#0000ff">To conduct oneself, to behave. How a poem acts marks its individual character. A poem by Glandolyn Blue does not sound like a poem by Timothy Sure. To pretend, feign, impersonate. That, too, yes and always, because self-consciousness is its own pretension, and has been from its beginning; the human mind is capable of a great elastic theatre. </font></p>


            <h5 align="center"><font size="1px" color="3c3c3c">Ralph Angel joined the group chat</font></h5>



            <p class="left"><font color="#2f9187">The poem is an interpretation of weird theatrical shit. </font></p>



            <p class="left"><font color="#0000ff">The weird theatrical shit is what goes on around us every day of our lives; an animal of only instinct, Johnny Ferret, has in his actions drama, but no theater; theater requires that you draw a circle around the action and observe it from outside the circle; in other words, self-consciousness is theatre.  </font></p>



            <p class="left"><font color="#0000ff">Everyone knows that if you query poets about how their poems begin, the answer is always the same:  </font></p>



            <p class="right"><font color="#f99615">a phrase, a line, a scrap of language, a rhythm, an image, something seen, heard, witnessed, or imagined. </font></p>



            <p class="left"><font color="#0000ff">And the lesson is always the same, and young poets recognize this to be one of the most important lessons they can learn: 
                </font></p>

             

        <p class="left"><font color="#0000ff">
        if you have any idea for a poem, an exact grid of intent, you are on the wrong path, </font></p>
        

            <p class="left"><font color="#0000ff">
        a dead-end alley, at the top of a cliff you haven‚Äôt even climbed. </font></p>



            <p class="left"><font color="#0000ff">This is a lesson that can only be learned by trial and error.  </font></p>



            <p class="right"><font color="#f99615">I believe many fine poems begin with ideas, but if you tell too many faces this, or tell it too loudly, they will get the wrong idea.  </font></p>



            <p class="left"><font color="#0000ff">Now here is something really interesting (to me), something you can use at a standing-up-only party when everyone is tired of hearing there are one million three-thousand-two-hundred-ninety-five words used by the Esimo for snow. 
            </font></p>



            <h5 align="center"><font size="1px" color="3c3c3c"> Ernest Fenollosa joined the group chat</font></h5>



            <p class="left"><font color="#ff4800">Some languages are so constructed‚ÄîEnglish among them‚Äîthat we each only really speak one sentence in our lifetime. 
            </font></p>



            <p class="left"><font color="#0000ff">That sentence begins with your first words, toddling around the kitchen, and ends with your last words right before you step into the limousine,   </font></p>



            <p class="right"><font color="#f99615">or in a nursing home, the night-duty attendant vaguely on hand. </font></p>



            <p class="left"><font color="#0000ff">Or, if you are blessed, they are heard by someone who knows you and loves you and will be sorry to hear the sentence end.  </font></p>



        <p class="left"><font color="#0000ff">
                Guess what Mr. Angel said about the lifelong sentence?</font></p>


                <p class="left"><font color="#2f9187">
                Give you a hint--period, comma, semicolon, OR question mark?</font></p>


            <p class="right"><font color="#f99615">That's a lot of semicolon!!!</font></p>

            <p class="left"><font color="#0000ff">Absolutely right;</font></p>
           
            <p class="right"><font color="#f99615">the sentence would be unwieldy and awkward and resemble the novel of a savant </font></p>
        <p class="left"><font color="#0000ff"> but the next time you use a semicolon (which, by the way, is the least-used mark of punctuation in all of poetry) you should stop and be thankful that there exists this little thing, invented by a human being‚Äîan Italian as a matter of fact‚Äîthat allows us to go on and keep on connecting speech that for all apparent purposes is unrelated. 
        </font></p>
        <p class="left"><font color="#0000ff"> You might say a poem is a semicolon, a living semicolon, what connects the first line to the last, the act of keeping together that whose nature is to fly apart. 
        </font></p>

        <p class="left"><font color="#0000ff"> Between the first and last lines there exists‚Äîa poem‚Äîand if it were not for the poem that intervenes, the first and last lines of a poem would not speak to each other.
        </font></p>

        <p class="right"><font color="#f99615">Would not speak to each other. </font></p>

        <p class="left"><font color="#0000ff"> Because the lines of a poem are speaking to each other, not you to them or they to you.
        </font></p>

        <p class="left"><font color="#0000ff"> I will tell you what I miss: </font></p>

        <p class="left"><font color="#0000ff"> I miss watching a movie and at the end, huge scrolled words come on the screen and say:  
        </font></p>

        <p class="left"><font color="#0000ff"> The End.
        </font></p>

        <p class="right"><font color="#f99615" size="6px">ü•∞üôåüèº </font></p>

        <p class="right"><font color="#f99615">I miss finishing a novel and there on the last page, at a discrete distance from the last words of the last sentence, are the dark letters spelling The End. </font></p>
  
        <p class="left"><font color="#0000ff"> It was its own thrill. I didn‚Äôt ignore them, I read them, even if only silently, with a deep sense of feeling: both the feeling of being replete, a feeling of satisfaction, and the feeling of loss, the sadness of having finished the book. </font></p>

        <p class="left"><font color="#0000ff"> I have never,  </font></p>

        <p class="left"><font color="#0000ff"> in my life,  </font></p>

        <p class="left"><font color="#0000ff"> read a poem that ended with the words The End.  </font></p>

        <p class="right"><font color="#f99615">Why is that, I wonder. </font></p>
 
        <p class="left"><font color="#0000ff"> I think perhaps the brevity of poems compared to novels makes one feel that there has been no great sustention of energy, no marathon worthy of pulling tape across the finish line. </font></p>

        <p class="left"><font color="#0000ff"> And then I found a poem of mine that I had carefully written by hand in the sixth grade, and at the bottom of the page, in India ink, beautifully apart from the rest of the text, were the words </font></p>

        <p class="right"><font color="#f99615">The End. 
        </font></p>

        <p class="left"><font color="#0000ff"> And I realized children very often denote the end because it is indeed a great achievement for them to have written anything, and they are completely unaware of the number of stories and poems that have already been written;  </font></p>

        <p class="left"><font color="#0000ff"> they know some, of course, but have not yet found out the extent to which they are not the only persons residing on the planet. And so they sign their poems and stories like kings.  </font></p>

        <p class="right"><font color="#f99615">Which is a wonderful thing. </font></p>

        <p class="left"><font color="#04a1d1"> There are three ways to finish any piece of writing: the ending will have the last word or the ending will be silent or the ending will execute a pirouette, do something unexpectedly incongruent.  </font></p>

        <p class="left"><font color="#5f13c2"> The single most succinct and astonishing thing: We begin in admiration and we end by organizing our disappointment.   </font></p>

        <p class="right"><font color="#f99615">The moment of admiration is the experience of something unfiltered, vital and fresh‚Äîit could also be horror‚Äîand the moment of organization is both the onset of disappointment and its dignification; </font></p>
 
        <p class="right"><font color="#f99615">the least we can do is dignify our knowingness, the loss of some vitality through familiarization, by admiring not the thing itself but how we can organize it, </font></p>

        <p class="right"><font color="#f99615">think about it.  </font></p>

        <p class="left"><font color="#0000ff"> I am afraid there is no way around this. It is the one try inevitable thing. And if you believe that, then you are conceding that in the beginning was the act, not the word.

        <p class="left"><font color="#ff009d"> Perhaps all we can say, and even this may be too much, is that varying degrees or states of tension seem to be involved in all our experiences, and that the most gratifying ones are those in which whatever tensions are created are also released.
        </font></p>

        <p class="left"><font color="#ff009d"> Or, to use another familiar set of terms, an experience is gratifying to the extent that those expectations that are aroused are also fulfilled.</font></p>

        <p class="left"><font color="#0000ff"> Credit: @Barbara Henstein Smith's book Poetic Closure: A Study of How Poems End</font></p>

        <p class="right"><font color="#f99615">But there is no book I know of on the subject of how poems begin. </font></p>
 
        <p class="right"><font color="#f99615">How can the origin be traced when there is no form or shape that precedes it to trace? </font></p>

        <p class="left"><font color="#0000ff"> It is exactly like tracing the moment of the big bang‚Äîwe can go back to a nanosecond before the beginning, before the universe burst into being, but we can‚Äôt go back to the precise beginning because that would precede knowledge, and we can‚Äôt ‚Äúknow‚Äù anything before ‚Äúknowing‚Äù itself was born. </font></p>
 
        <p class="left"><font color="#0000ff"> I have flipped through books, reading hundreds of opening and closing lines, across ages, across cultures, across aesthetic schools,  </font></p>
 
        <p class="left"><font color="#0000ff"> and I have discovered that first lines are remarkably similar, even repeated. 
        </font></p>

        <p class="right"><font color="#f99615">Of course in all cases they remain remarkably distinct, because the words belong to completely different poems.  </font></p>

        <p class="left"><font color="#0000ff"> And i began to realize, reading these first and last lines, that there are not only the first and last lines of the lifelong sentence we each speak but also the first and last lines of the long piece of language delivered to use by others, by those we listen to.  </font></p>
  
        <p class="left"><font color="#0000ff"> And in the best of all possible lives, that beginning and that end are the same: in poem after poem I encountered words that mark the first something made out of language that we hear as children repeated night after night, </font></p>

        <p class="left"><font color="#0000ff"> like a refrain: I love you. I am here with you. Don‚Äôt be afraid. Go to sleep now. </font></p>

        <p class="left"><font color="#0000ff"> And I encountered words that mark the last something made out of language that we hope to hear on earth: </font></p>
