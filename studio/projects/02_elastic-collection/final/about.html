            Clothing is just an accessory that showcases a part of a person's identity and doesn't represent their entirety. Since we live in New York City, a place known for its high tolerance of diverse styles, why can't we enjoy the artistic atmosphere and wear what we want to wear and do what we want to do? While people's professions may reflect their expertise and interests, they should still be free to dress in any style that makes them happy, and nobody has the right to judge them. I've seen people on the streets assume someone is an engineer just because they're wearing jeans and a plaid shirt, while others are surprised to see someone dressed walking into a design school. I've also heard about fashion design students who feel obligated to dress up every day and hardly wear puffy jackets to class because they feel tired due to their major. So, I want to create a "major game" by collecting bags from students in different majors at The New School to see if people can accurately guess a backpack wearer's major based on their bag style. This game emphasizes that a person's style has no correlation with their principal, and nobody should feel pressured to change their appearance based on their school or major. Everyone should be unique, and everyone should be accepting. Choosing items for the bag also holds a hidden meaning: understanding someone's inner self is often more accurate than judging them solely based on their outward appearance.
